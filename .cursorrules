# Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- React with Next.js (App Router)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- NPM as package manager

## Code Style
- Functional and minimalist — avoid over-engineering
- Prefer pure functions and immutability where practical
- Keep components and functions small and focused
- No unnecessary abstractions

## Architecture
- Follow hexagonal architecture principles
- Decouple UI (adapters) from domain logic (core)
- Domain logic should have no dependencies on frameworks or UI
- Use dependency injection for external services and side effects
- Design for testability with interfaces/ports that can be mocked

### Structure
```
actions/           # Server actions
app/               # Next.js App Router (pages, layouts)
components/        # Shared UI components
features/          # Domain logic
  [domain-name]/
    types/         # Domain types and interfaces
    services/      # Pure functions (with unit tests alongside)
    adapters/      # Data fetching classes (ports/adapters)
    mocks/         # Test mocks for adapters
```

## Testing
- Use Jest for testing domain logic
- Domain tests should be fast and isolated
- Use mocks for infrastructure dependencies
- Focus tests on behavior, not implementation details

## General
- Keep it simple — only build what's needed
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- No strict naming conventions — use clear, descriptive names
